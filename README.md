## About the Project

## Getting Started

0. Clone the repo. I'd recommend using the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) to run `gh repo clone DangerousSpaceSquad/artshop` in your terminal.
1. Get [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/windows-install/).
2. Run `aws configure` in the command line. For the time being, you'll need to fill in some secret values, which you can get from Kyle.
3. With Docker open, run `./deployment/run.sh` from the `artshop` directory, in Bash.
    * Options to run the development environment in Windows natively to come.
4. Connect to <http://localhost:8080> in your web browser of choice.

## Contributing

If you've been invited to collaborate, take the take the following steps to add new features:

1. [Create a new branch](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository). There are lots of ways to do this, but if you've already downloaded/cloned the project, the easiest is:  
    * With the project open in VSCode,  
    * Click the branch symbol at the bottom left.  
    * Click "Create new branch..."  
    * Name the branch after the feature you want to add, e.g. `ImageCarousel`.
2. Make any changes you'd like. Remember that we follow test driven development, so design your tests *before* your code if at all possible.
    * Check the `/documentation/` directory for any relevant documentation 
3. Run the tests and ensure your code passes. **TODO: Once CI is finished, add test command here**
4. Push your changes.  
    * In VSCode, go to the Source Control tab by clicking the branching symbol on the left pane.
    * Commit your changes to your branch.
    * Click the push arrow at the bottom left to upload your changes to the github repo.
    * Repeat steps 2 though 4 as many times as you like while you develop parts of your new feature.
5. Once the feature is done, submit a [Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) in github.
    * Once reviewed and tested, your changes will automatically appear on the live version of the site.
